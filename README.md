# `colorist` bundle: write you documents in a colorful way

A collection of styles and classes that helps you typesetting articles and books
with a colorful design. It mainly consists of two parts.

- Main part:
    - `colorist.sty` : the main style
    - `colorart.cls` : class for typesetting articles
    - `colorbook.cls` : class for typesetting books

    They can be used with any major TeX engine. Currently they have native
    support to English, French and German typesetting. (I have planed to add
    more language support)


- Derivative part (they have separate pages on CTAN):
    - lebhart.cls : more advanced class for typesetting articles
    - beaulivre.cls : more advanced class for typesetting books

    They are similar to the main classes, but have unicode support, thus can
    only be used with either XeLaTeX or LuaLaTeX. Currently they have native
    support to Chinese (both simplified and traditional), English, French,
    German, Japanese and Russian typesetting, and also use more
    beautiful fonts. (I have planed to add more language support)
