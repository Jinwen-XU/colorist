# `colorist` bundle: write you documents in a colorful way

This is collection of styles and classes for typesetting articles and books in a
colorful design. It mainly consists of two parts.

- Main part:
    - colorist.sty : the main style
    - colorart.cls : class for typesetting articles
    - colorbook.cls : class for typesetting books

    They can be used with any major TeX engine. Currently they have native
    support to English and French typesetting. (I have planed to add more
    language support)


- Derivative part (they have separate pages on CTAN):
    - lebhart.cls : more advanced class for typesetting articles
    - beaulivre.cls : more advanced class for typesetting books

    They are similar to the main classes, but have unicode support, thus can
    only be used with either XeLaTeX or LuaLaTeX. Currently they have native
    support to English, French and Chinese typesetting, and also use more
    beautiful fonts. (I have planed to add more language support)
