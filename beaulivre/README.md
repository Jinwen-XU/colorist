> **New documentations are being written and are expected to be completed by the end of 2023. In the meantime, only the core code would be included in TeX Live 2023 coming this April (old documentations have been removed from the distribution).**

`beaulivre` is a LaTeX class for typesetting books, which has a colorful design.

Currently, it has native support to Chinese (simplified and traditional), English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese (European and Brazilian), Russian and Spanish typesetting. And it may compile with either XeLaTeX or LuaLaTeX.

This is part of the `colorist` class series.

## Features

Compared with usual document classes, it has the following features:

- Several carefully designed styles
- Native multi-language support: Chinese (simplified and traditional), English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese (European and Brazilian), Russian and Spanish
    > In particular, for simplified Chinese, traditional Chinese and Japanese, the fonts of the corresponding glyphs can be automatically switched
- Ready-to-use theorem-like environments, with clever referencing support
- ... and so much more...
